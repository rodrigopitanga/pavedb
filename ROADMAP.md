# Roadmap

tl;dr: This roadmap tracks production readiness and integration milestones. To claim a
task, open an issue titled `claim: <task ID>` and link your branch or PR.
Detailed design plans live under `docs/` and are indexed after the task tables.

> PaveDB is a general-purpose vector search engine. The roadmap that follows is
> driven by production readiness for its first downstream consumer — an application
> that maps natural-language queries to structured codes via semantic search in a
> non-English language. The core product metric is **time saved to reach the correct
> results**. Every TODO is evaluated against that metric and general production
> readiness.

## Design Principles

These are non-negotiable constraints that apply across all versions.

- **Zero boilerplate by default.** A working setup requires no org, workspace, profile,
  or grouping ceremony. Create a collection and go. Groupings, limits, and profiles are
  opt-in — never required for a basic setup.
- **Collection independence.** Collections are not owned by tenants. The tenant is a
  runtime namespace, not a structural owner. Collections must be fully portable: export
  from one instance/tenant, import into another without data loss or format surprise.
  This is a logical portability/lifecycle guarantee, not a promise that each
  collection maps to its own physical DB file, DB instance, or vector service.
- **Transparency by default.** Developers must be able to see what was indexed, what
  chunks were produced, what metadata is stored. Opacity is a DX failure.
- **Layered independence.** Auth, tenant profiles, collections, and server configuration
  are orthogonal concerns. No layer forces coupling to another. A tenant can exist
  without a profile; a collection can exist without a custom embedding config.
- **Optional tenant groupings ("syndicates").** When tenant grouping is needed (e.g.
  for org-level quotas or shared collections), it is expressed as a lightweight
  syndicate
  — an opt-in overlay, not a mandatory hierarchy. No boilerplate orgs/workspaces.
- **Server and library are the same thing.** PaveDB must run equally well as an HTTP
  microservice and as an in-process Python library (embedded, single-tenant, no
  uvicorn).
  The service layer is the API; HTTP is just one transport.
- **Media types are progressive, not baked in.** Text is the baseline. Every additional
  media type (images, audio, video, and beyond) is added through a stable ingest plugin
  interface without touching the core. The plugin contract must be stable before any
  specific media type ships.
- **Collections are version-safe.** Every collection records the PaveDB version and schema
  version it was written with. Incompatible reads must fail loudly with actionable
  guidance, not silently corrupt. Migration tooling ships alongside breaking changes.
- **PaveDB enforces limits; it does not govern business logic.** Resource limits,
  quotas, and tier profiles are read from a manifest and applied at runtime. Billing,
  onboarding, and payment are outside PaveDB's scope — it just reads a file.

  (P1-29b slice A).~~
- ~~Finish `P1-29b` with Faiss backend cutover and SQL-path removal.~~
- ~~Add first `CollectionDB` k/v pre-filter stage (P1-29c).~~
- ~~Reject empty/colliding sanitized metadata keys instead of silently
  dropping/coalescing them (P1-36).~~
- ~~Pre-orchestrator cleanup: drop txtai, rename store/embedder/metadb,
  remove dead code, simplify filter path (P1-37).~~
- ~~Build store orchestrator: CollectionDB + FaissBackend
  + embedder (P1-31).~~
- ~~Build public cross-language retrieval fixtures (P2-29).~~
- ~~Add benchmark CI gate + p99 latency SLO (P2-30).~~
- ~~`make build-check`: install from local wheel in temp venv, alive test (P3-52).~~
- ~~`make docker-check`: alive test against prebuilt Docker image (P3-51).~~
- ~~Rebranding phase 1 (runtime/operator surface changes) (P3-35).~~
- ~~Split `main.py` into APIRouter modules per domain (P3-50).~~
- ~~Add service-layer error logging for `ok: false` sites (P2-40).~~
- ~~TXT preprocessor: emit char `offset` in chunk metadata (P2-41).~~
- ~~Relicensing review (AGPLv3 candidate) (P3-34).~~

### PaveDB v0.9 — Inspectability

- ~~Get document by ID endpoint (P1-17).~~
- ~~CatalogDB + catalog separation (PLAN-SQLITE Phase 2), including
  collection backend/embedder config wiring (P1-33).~~
- ~~Response envelope standardization (P1-14).~~
- ~~Global `request_id` echo across endpoints and responses (P1-11).~~
- ~~Freeze search response schema (`matches`, `latency_ms`,
  `match_reason`, `request_id`); `query_id` added additively
  to enable replay from clients without scanning the log
  (P1-23).~~
- ~~Search timing breakdown in response: embed/search/filter/hydrate
  split alongside existing `latency_ms` (P1-40).~~
- ~~Persistent query log: store query text, filters, config snapshot,
  and result IDs in each collection's `meta.db` (P1-41).~~
- ~~Query replay endpoint: re-execute stored query at
  `POST /v1/collections/{t}/{c}/queries/{id}/replay` (P1-42).~~
- ~~Admin query-home resolver + shortcut routes + CLI rework:
  small `query_home` table in `catalog.db` mapping
  `query_id → tenant, collection`. Adds admin-only `GET` /
  `POST .../replay` at `/v1/admin/queries/{id}` delegating
  to P1-42 handlers after resolving the owning collection,
  plus admin-only CLI rework (`get-query` / `replay-query`
  accept a bare `<query_id>`; `list-queries` takes optional
  `--tenant` / `--collection` filters). No global HTTP
  listing (P1-51).~~
- ~~query_log + ops_log enrichment: `query_log` gains
  historical `tenant` / `collection` / `actor` columns
  (audit + portability); `ops_log` events gain `actor`
  (P2-46).~~
- ~~Chunk inspector + collection browser: list chunks, get chunk
  by ID (text + metadata + provenance), doc→chunk tree (P2-23).~~
- ~~Mount all routes under `/v1/` prefix; drop unversioned routes
  (no compat shim pre-GA). Contract: frozen at v1.0, additive
  only after (new endpoints, optional fields). `/v2/` introduced
  only if a `/v1/` shape must break (P1-43).~~
- ~~Rebranding phase 2: public-facing rename, env fallback removal,
  and `patchvec` → `pavedb` redirect/shim path (P3-35).~~
- ~~Remove `SearchBody.request_id`; `X-Request-ID` becomes the
  single documented input channel for request correlation
  (P1-48).~~
- ~~`bench-stress-full` profile: STR_SUITE=critical/full tiers
  with `@_covers` decorator + OpenAPI coverage warning;
  auto-discovery picks up any new `op_*` without touching
  `bench-stress.py`. Race-outcome reclassification keeps real
  5xx visible (P2-48).~~

### PaveDB v1.0 — Stability

- Define embedder/store separation contract (P3-26).
- ~~Activate embedder factory cache (P1-30; superseded by P1-29b).~~
- Per-collection embeddings (P1-32).
- Per-collection hot caches with isolation (P1-22).
- Embedded/library mode: import `pave` and use the store
  in-process — no server required. Lowers the install friction
  bar (Chroma-like first impression) without sacrificing the
  inspectability surface (P1-15).
- Reference-source plumbing pass — the docs site slips to v1.1,
  but v1.0 lands the source-of-truth so reference content can be
  rendered from code without re-writing it later:
  - OpenAPI completeness: every route gets summary/description/
    tags/responses; every Pydantic Field gets description + at
    least one example. Unblocks an auto-rendered API reference
    (P1-53a).
  - CLI completeness + dumper: every subcommand gets help and
    an epilog example; `scripts/cli_to_markdown.py` renders
    `reference/cli.md` committed in-repo (P1-53b).
  - Config schema refactor: single (key, default, description,
    env_var) source feeds `_DEFAULTS`, `config.yml.example`, and
    `reference/config.md`. Closes the P1-26 drift check as a
    side effect (P1-53c).
  - Module/class docstrings on public seams: `pave/stores`,
    `pave/backends`, `pave/embedders`, catalog, and
    `pave/service.py` public functions. Powers `mkdocstrings`
    when the docs site lands at v1.1 (P1-53d).
- Dev vs prod config defaults (P1-25).
- ~~Explicit config bootstrap for pip installs (`pavecli init`,
  `--home`, explicit runtime paths) (P1-34).~~
- Add capability-based filter pushdown with parity checks against
  canonical post-filter semantics (P1-35).
- Admin key auto-generate + persist (P1-27).
- Config reference doc + CI drift check — lands as a side effect
  of P1-53c (P1-26).
- Publish `pip freeze` snapshot as release artifact (P3-40).
- ~~List tenants and collections via API (CLI parity) (P2-12).~~
- HTTP request metrics middleware: single middleware records
  per-endpoint count + latency histogram labeled by method,
  path template, and status class. Removes per-handler `inc`
  sprawl. Adds `# HELP`/`# TYPE` metadata and standard
  histogram buckets to `/metrics`. Prometheus parity baseline
  (P1-49).
- Product-signal metrics: zero-match search rate, filter-usage
  split, common-merge count, search timeout count, query-log
  rows + oldest-entry age, embedder counters, sidecar drift
  gauges. Signals competitors don't expose; directly ties
  metrics to the inspectability thesis (P1-50).
- Concurrency chaos test (Level 1): N-thread random-interleave
  fuzz over create/delete/rename/ingest/search/dump/restore with
  post-run catalog↔disk invariants. Locks in the lock-lattice
  hardening done during the v0.9 rc cycle; turns races
  bench-stress catches into non-flaky CI checks (P1-52).

### PaveDB v1.1 — Adoption

- Docs site — preview: MkDocs Material static site published via
  GitLab Pages. Most reference content auto-rendered from the
  source plumbing landed at v1.0 (P1-53a–d); hand-written content
  is small (index, concepts, inspect walkthrough). Text-first, no
  marketing chrome (P1-46).
- Python client package (`pave`): unified Python API that wraps the
  in-process library mode (v1.0) and an HTTP client for remote
  instances behind the same interface. Same package, two transports
  (P1-24).
- Batch ingest endpoint (list of documents in one call).

### PaveDB v1.2 — Control

- Docs site — 1.0: expand the v1.1 preview to full release
  coverage. User-facing: install, quickstart, core concepts,
  auth, ingest, search, filters, inspect/debug, operations
  (config, limits, metrics, health). Developer-facing:
  architecture, service/store/embedder seams, plugin contract,
  internals. Versioned via `mike`, custom domain, search,
  dark/light theme. Seeds future language translations (P1-47).
- Honor `meta.priority` boosts during scoring (P2-11).
- Add hybrid reranking (vector similarity + BM25/token
  matching) (P1-07).
- Result diff API: compare two search runs — added/removed/reordered
  hits (P2-42).
- Eval assertion API: define expected results per query, batch run,
  track pass/fail over time (P2-43).
- Regression detection: compare eval runs across versions, flag
  drift (P2-44).
- Config snapshot per collection: record embedder model + version +
  search params at ingest time (P2-45).
- Structured log retention: rolling window + purge via
  `operation_log` table (SQLite Phase 3); powers P2-13 (P2-39).

### PaveDB v1.3 — Reach

- `pavecli --host`: route CLI commands through the HTTP client
  instead of the service layer directly; depends on Python client.
  CLI becomes a thin wrapper.
- JavaScript/TypeScript client: typed, bootstrapped from OpenAPI
  spec, published to npm. Covers web frontends and Node.js backends.
- LangChain `VectorStore` + `Retriever` adapter (covers LangGraph
  + CrewAI).
- MCP server (expose search/ingest/list as MCP tools).
- LlamaIndex `VectorStore` adapter.

### PaveDB v1.4 — Polish

- Default tenant/collection selectors in Swagger UI.
- Collection-level structured log export for analytics.
- Alive test in CI pipeline (post-deploy health check).
- Docs website (public docs, API reference).
- Full-surface stress profile for every public endpoint,
  off by default (P2-48).
- Revamp UI.
- Multilingual UI/errors/docs.
- Usage stats to mothership (opt-in/anon).

### PaveDB v1.5 — Lifecycle

- Tenant admin infrastructure (P2-19).
- Per-tenant collection count limit (P2-20).
- Per-tenant storage limit (P2-21).
- Per-collection storage accounting: `document_bytes` exposed for
  quota surfaces; `chunk_bytes` admin-only (P2-47).
- Collection version tagging (P2-25).
- Formalize collection independence from tenant (P2-31).

### PaveDB v1.6 — Governance

- Tenant key management API: `POST /admin/tenants/{tenant}/keys`,
  `DELETE /admin/tenants/{tenant}/keys/{id}`. Seed `tenants.yml`
  into SQL on first boot; SQL becomes source of truth for keys
  and limits thereafter.
- OIDC/JWT as opt-in alternative auth (`auth.oidc.issuer` config);
  API keys remain permanently supported. PaveDB accepts either on
  any request.
- Tenant profiles: manifest-driven resource limits (memory,
  storage, concurrency, models available), profile templates
  (e.g. free/paid tiers); PaveDB enforces limits, does not
  handle billing or onboarding.
- Extensible ingest plugin architecture (stable plugin interface
  for custom preprocessors and future media types).
- Delete by ID list and delete by metadata query
  (single-collection scope first).
- Commit to independence principle: auth, tenant profiles,
  collections, and server config are orthogonal — no coupling
  between layers.

### PaveDB v1.7 — Maturity

- Document versioning, rebuild tooling.
- Collection migration tooling: detect version mismatches,
  provide upgrade path across PaveDB/FAISS version changes.
- Persistent metrics in the UI.

### PaveDB v1.8 — Scale

- Async ingest, parallel purge.
- Horizontal scalability, tenant groups, sub-index routing.
- Retain original uploaded files, opt-in (originals + versioning
  hooks).
- Async ingest jobs with status tracking API.
- Per-tenant parallel ingest limits.
- Matrix CI builds (Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 × core ML versions)
  as pre-2.0 compatibility gate.

### PaveDB v2.0 — Ground Truth

- Lock routes, publish final OpenAPI spec, ship SDK clients.
- Audit logs for admin actions.

### PaveDB post-2.0 backlog (no IDs yet)
- Additional media types (image, audio/video, graphic/geom,
  georeferenced) via ingest plugin architecture.
- Go client.
- Tenant job notifications (webhook/email).
- Tenant syndicates (opt-in grouping, no mandatory hierarchy).
- Multimodal collections: images, audio, and text in a shared vector space
  (cross-modal search; requires model architecture commitment).
- Vector dimension/schema guardrails.
- Soft-delete + TTL policies.
- Snapshot/backup automation.
- Index rebuild / compaction tooling.
- Filter indexes / prefilter cache.
- Drift/quality monitoring.
- Resource limits (RAM/index caps).
- Cold-start mitigation (warming hooks).
- Approx-search tuning config.

## Source Code Observations

### What is solid

- **Multi-tenant isolation** (`t_{tenant}/c_{collection}` layout) is clean and
well-tested. Production consumers already use it correctly.
- **Filter system** is expressive (wildcards, comparisons, datetime, negation,
OR/AND). Real consumer code exercises most filter features.
- **SQL injection prevention** (`_sanit_sql`, `_sanit_field`, `_sanit_meta_dict`)
is thorough and has dedicated tests.
- **Pluggable architecture** (BaseStore/BaseEmbedder ABCs, factory pattern) makes
it straightforward to swap backends without touching consumers.
- **Chunk text sidecar storage** guarantees text is always retrievable even when
the vector index loses content — a practical reliability win.
- **Auth policy enforcement** (`enforce_policy`) correctly prevents auth=none in
production. The loopback-only dev mode is a good guardrail.
- **Data archive/restore** with lock acquisition is operationally useful for
backup and migration.

### What needed attention (code-level) — resolved

1. ~~**`eval()` in filter matching** — replaced with `operator` module
comparisons. (done v0.5.7)~~
2. ~~**Global singleton at import time** — `build_app()` made lazy.
(done v0.5.8)~~
3. ~~**`assert` in production code** — replaced with runtime check.
(done v0.5.7)~~
4. ~~**Lock dict not thread-safe** — guarded with module-level lock.
(done v0.5.7)~~
5. ~~**Embedder factory unused** — resolved by store split
(P1-29/P1-31). Embedder factory is now the active path.
(done v0.5.9)~~
6. ~~**QdrantStore dead stub** — deleted along with `qdrant-client`
dependency. (done v0.5.9, P1-37)~~
7. ~~**Preprocess reads config at import** — chunking parameters
now passed through constructor/function args. (done v0.5.9,
P1-31)~~

## Market Practices (extracted from real-time decisioning benchmarks)

> PaveDB serves downstream consumers the same way a geo-bidding engine
> serves ad campaigns: both are real-time decisioning systems that must
> return the right answer fast under concurrent load. The patterns below
> are table-stakes in that domain.

### 1. Return `latency_ms` in every search response

Real-time decisioning APIs mandate `latency_ms` in every response body. PaveDB now
returns `latency_ms` (done v0.5.7).

**Why it matters:** The core metric for consumers is time saved. If PaveDB returns
`latency_ms`, consumers can log it alongside every request, giving operators concrete
data to prove and monitor value.

**Gap:** None. (done v0.5.7)

**Effort:** Low. Wrap `do_search` in `time.perf_counter()`, add field to response dict.

### 2. Define an explicit latency SLO and enforce it in CI

~~Production decisioning APIs require p99 latency SLOs.~~

**Status:** Done (v0.5.9). Benchmark suite with `--slo-p99-ms` and
`--max-error-pct` exit gates, wired into Makefile and GitLab CI
(P2-30).

### 3. Hot-reload data and configuration without restart

Production APIs require hot-reloading configuration without downtime. PaveDB's
equivalent: updating indexed data or swapping embedding models without restarting the
server.

**Current state (v0.5.9):** Document purge + re-index works live. Embedder
is constructed per-collection via factory. Chunking parameters are passed
through constructor args (no import-time config reads). Config changes
still require process restart for the embedder model.

**Action for v0.5.7:** ~~Document the live-data-update path (purge +
ingest)~~ as an explicit operational procedure. For v1.0 (per-collection
embeddings), design model hot-swap via a `/admin/reload` endpoint.

### 4. Pre-computation beats post-filtering

The equivalent of spatial indexing for geo queries: pushing filters into
the SQLite pre-filter instead of post-filtering in Python.

**Current state (v0.5.9):** `CollectionDB.filter_by_meta()` handles
exact-match and negation pushdown. Wildcards and comparisons remain in
the canonical Python post-filter (`matches_filters()`). The legacy
`_split_filters()` was removed in P1-37.

**Why it matters:** If consumers fire multiple parallel searches and
most use post-filtering, tail latency multiplies. At scale, this
becomes the bottleneck.

**Action:** Negation (`!value`) already goes to SQL (`<>`) — done
v0.5.7. Next step (P1-35) is capability-based pushdown with parity
checks against canonical post-filter semantics.

### 5. Graceful degradation under overload

Production APIs must degrade gracefully (e.g., shed low-priority work, return partial
results) rather than failing entirely under load.

~~**Status:** Done (v0.5.8). Configurable search timeout +
`max_concurrent_searches` with 503 fast-fail (P1-20). Per-tenant
rate limiting (P1-08).~~

### 6. Benchmark suite as a first-class artifact

Performance benchmarks are not optional documentation — they are proof of performance
claims and regression gates.

**Why it matters:** When optimizing PaveDB, you need a regression baseline. When
choosing between embedding models, you need comparable latency/recall numbers. When
consumers evaluate PaveDB against alternatives, benchmarks are the first thing they
look for.

~~**Status:** Done (v0.5.9). `benchmarks/search_latency.py` and
`benchmarks/stress.py` with SLO gates (P2-30). Public relevance
regression suite (P2-29).~~

### 7. Request/response traceability as contract

Distributed systems require `request_id` in both request and response. This is the
minimum contract for any service that participates in a call chain.

**Current state:** `request_id` is accepted and echoed in
responses. The v0.9 cleanup narrows the public input
contract to `X-Request-ID`.

**Action:** Remove `SearchBody.request_id`, use
`X-Request-ID` as the request-correlation input, and keep
echoing the resulting `request_id` in responses and
structured log entries. This closes the observability gap
between consumers and PaveDB.

### 8. Concurrency safety as explicit contract (not assumed)

Production APIs must handle concurrent requests correctly as a must-have, not a nice-to-
have.

~~**Status:** Done (v0.5.7). Lock registry guarded with module-level
lock. Concurrency safety hardened further in store split (P1-31,
v0.5.9).~~

### Summary: What the market expects from a real-time decisioning API

| Practice | Geo-bidding benchmark | PaveDB | Status |
|----------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| Latency in response body | `latency_ms` | Returned by search | **DONE** |
| Latency SLO + benchmarks | p99 <50ms | CI gate + SLO exit (P2-30) | **DONE** |
| Hot-reload without downtime | Hot reload | Model swap needs restart | **Partial** |
| Pre-computation / indexing | Precompute | SQLite pushdown + negation | **DONE** |
| Graceful degradation | Shed load | Search timeout + concurrency cap | **DONE** |
| Request ID propagation | `request_id` | Echoed in responses | **DONE** |
| Concurrency safety | Thread-safe | Store-level locking (P1-31) | **DONE** |
| Budget / quota governance | Quotas | Per-tenant rate limiting (P1-08) | **DONE** |

One of eight practices is still partial (hot-reload / model swap).

## Pluggability: PaveDB as a General-Purpose Vector Search Microservice

> Secondary priority — after the first consumer reaches GA. But
> architectural decisions made in v0.5.7–v1.0 determine whether this
> path is cheap or a rewrite.

### The landscape (as of early 2026)

There is **no standard vector store API**. Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Milvus
— each has a proprietary REST API. The de facto unifying layers are:

1. **LangChain `VectorStore`** — the dominant abstraction. Implementing it
covers LangChain, LangGraph, AND CrewAI (which delegates to LangChain's VectorStore
internally). Two abstract methods: `add_texts()`, `from_texts()`. Plus
`similarity_search()`, `similarity_search_with_score()`, `delete()` for full
functionality.

2. **LlamaIndex `VectorStore`** — second framework. Different interface but
similar surface: `add()`, `delete()`, `query()`. Supports dense search and metadata
filtering.

3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — NOT dead. Adopted by OpenAI (March
2025), Google DeepMind, and hundreds of tool providers. 2026 is the enterprise adoption
year. Qdrant, Pinecone, and MindsDB already ship MCP servers for vector search. MCP lets
any compatible AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, custom) search the vector store directly — no
SDK needed on the agent side.

4. **OpenAI Vector Store API** — proprietary to OpenAI's platform
(Assistants/Retrieval). NOT a standard others implement. Implementing compatibility
would be cargo-culting with no adoption benefit.

### What PaveDB has today (v0.5.9)

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| REST API (FastAPI) | **Solid** | OpenAPI spec; APIRouter modules per domain. |
| OpenAPI schema | **Solid** | Swagger UI with filtered views (search/ingest). |
| Multi-tenancy | **Solid** | `tenant/collection` namespacing — a real differentiator. |
| File preprocessing | **Unique** | CSV/PDF/TXT built-in. |
| Benchmarks + SLO | **Solid** | Latency + stress suites with CI gate (P2-30). |
| Structured logging | **Solid** | JSON ops log with request_id, tenant, latency (P2-28). |
| Python SDK (client) | **Planned** | v1.1 — `pave` package for HTTP + library mode. |
| LangChain adapter | **Planned** | v1.3 — `VectorStore` subclass. |
| LlamaIndex adapter | **Planned** | v1.3 — `VectorStore` implementation. |
| MCP server | **Planned** | v1.3 — tool exposure for AI agents. |

### What PaveDB does NOT need

- **OpenAI-compatible API** — There is no "OpenAI vector store standard"
that third parties implement. OpenAI's Vector Store API is platform-locked. Skip.

- **gRPC (short term)** — REST is sufficient for the current latency targets.
gRPC matters at >10k req/s with sub-5ms budgets. Not the current reality.

- **GraphQL** — No vector store uses it. No framework expects it. Skip.

### What PaveDB needs (in priority order)

#### 1. Python SDK — `pave` client package (~150 lines)

A thin HTTP wrapper that maps PaveDB's REST API to Python method calls.
This is the foundation everything else wraps.

```python
from pave import PaveClient

client = PaveClient("http://localhost:8086", api_key="...")
client.create_collection("tenant", "my_collection")
client.ingest("tenant", "my_collection", file_path="data.csv")
results = client.search("tenant", "my_collection", "example query", k=5)
```

**Why:** Every vector DB ships a client SDK. Without one, PaveDB integration requires
raw `httpx`/`requests` calls, which nobody does in 2026. This is table-stakes.

**Effort:** Low. ~150 lines wrapping the existing REST endpoints.

**When:** v1.1 (after API stabilizes in v1.0).

#### 2. LangChain `VectorStore` adapter (~200 lines)

Implement `langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore`:
- `add_texts(texts, metadatas)` → calls `POST /collections/{t}/{c}/documents`
- `similarity_search(query, k, filter)` → calls `POST /collections/{t}/{c}/search`
- `similarity_search_with_score(query, k)` → same, returns scores
- `delete(ids)` → calls document delete endpoint (needs P1-6 first)
- `from_texts(texts, embedding)` → creates collection + ingests

This single adapter covers:
- **LangChain** chains and agents
- **LangGraph** stateful agent graphs
- **CrewAI** agents and tools (delegates to LangChain VectorStore)

```python
from pave.integrations.langchain import PaveVectorStore

store = PaveVectorStore(
    client=client, tenant="my_tenant", collection="my_collection"
)
retriever = store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
```

**Why:** LangChain is the dominant orchestrator. A single adapter covers three major
frameworks.

**Effort:** ~200 lines. Depends on Python SDK.

**When:** v1.3 (immediately after SDK).

#### 3. MCP server (~300 lines)

Expose PaveDB operations as MCP tools:
- `search_collection(tenant, collection, query, k, filters)` → search
- `ingest_document(tenant, collection, file_path)` → upload
- `list_collections(tenant)` → list (~~needs P2-12 first~~ done)

```json
{
  "name": "search_collection",
  "description": "Search a PaveDB collection using semantic similarity",
  "parameters": {
    "tenant": "string",
    "collection": "string",
    "query": "string",
    "k": "integer"
  }
}
```

**Why:** MCP is the standard protocol for AI agent ↔ tool communication. Qdrant,
Pinecone, MindsDB already ship MCP servers. Without one, PaveDB is invisible to the
fastest-growing integration channel. An MCP server backed by PaveDB lets any MCP-
compatible AI assistant search indexed data directly.

**Effort:** ~300 lines. MCP Python SDK is well-documented.

**When:** v1.3 (after API freeze candidates are stable).

#### 4. LlamaIndex adapter (~200 lines)

Similar to LangChain but implements LlamaIndex's `VectorStore` protocol:
- `add(nodes)` → ingest
- `delete(ref_doc_id)` → delete
- `query(query_bundle)` → search with metadata filters

**Why:** Second-largest orchestrator framework. Smaller ROI than LangChain but completes
the coverage.

**When:** v1.3.

### PaveDB's positioning in the vector DB landscape

PaveDB is not Qdrant or Pinecone. It does not compete on billion-vector scale or sub-
millisecond latency. Its niche is:

**"The SQLite of vector search"** — embed it, no cluster, no cloud, good enough for most
workloads under 10M vectors.

| | PaveDB | ChromaDB | Qdrant | Pinecone |
|---|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Deployment | Single-process | Single-process | Docker/K8s | Managed |
| Multi-tenancy | Built-in | No | Namespaces | Namespaces |
| File preprocessing | CSV/PDF/TXT | No | No | No |
| Embedding choice | Pluggable | BYO | BYO | BYO |
| Filtering | Expressive | Basic | Rich | Basic |
| Inspectability | Query log, replay, chunk inspector | No | No | No |
| License | AGPL-3.0 | Apache-2.0 | Apache-2.0 | Proprietary |

The **built-in preprocessing**, **multi-tenancy**, and **inspectability**
are real differentiators. ChromaDB, the closest lightweight competitor,
has none of them.

### Architectural decisions that affect pluggability NOW

These are decisions in v0.5.7–v1.0 that determine whether the integration layer (v1.1+)
is cheap or expensive:

1. **Stabilize the search response schema** — If `do_search()` returns
`{matches: [{id, score, text, meta}]}` today and changes later, every adapter breaks.
Freeze the response shape in v0.5.7. Add new fields (`latency_ms`, `match_reason`,
`request_id`) now, so the schema is stable by v1.0.

2. **Document delete by ID** (P1-6) — LangChain's `delete()` method
requires this. Without it, the LangChain adapter ships incomplete.

3. **Per-collection embedding config** (v1.0) — LangChain's `from_texts()`
passes an `embedding` parameter. PaveDB must be able to accept external
embeddings OR let the caller specify which model to use per collection.
Embedder factory (v0.5.9) provides the foundation; per-collection config
wiring lands in v1.0 (P1-32).

4. ~~**List collections** (P2-12)~~ — Both LangChain and MCP need enumeration.
Status: done.

5. ~~**`BaseStore.search()` return type** — Currently returns
`List[Dict[str, Any]]`. For SDK/adapter consumption, a typed dataclass (e.g.,
`SearchResult(id, score, text, meta)`) would be cleaner. This is a v0.9 candidate.~~

### Integration roadmap

| Version | Deliverable | Depends on |
|---------|------------|------------|
| v1.1 | Python client (`pave`): HTTP + library mode | Stable REST API (v1.0) |
| v1.1 | Embedded mode, batch ingest | Python client |
| v1.3 | `pavecli --host` (remote CLI via HTTP client) | Python client |
| v1.3 | JS/TS client (npm) | OpenAPI spec (auto-generated, then typed) |
| v1.3 | LangChain `VectorStore` adapter | Python client |
| v1.3 | MCP server | Python client |
| v1.3 | LlamaIndex adapter | Python client |
| post-1.8 | Go client (Go module, generated) | Stable OpenAPI spec |
| ~~v0.9~~ | ~~Typed response models~~ | ~~API freeze~~ |
| 2.0 | Published integrations on PyPI/npm (`pave-langchain`, `pave-mcp`) | API freeze |
| post-2.0 | Rust client (WASM target) | API freeze |

### What this means for the revised version milestones

**v0.9** gains:
- Freeze search response schema (add `latency_ms`, `match_reason`, `request_id`).
- Typed return models as internal preparation.

**v1.1** gains:
- Python SDK client package.

**v1.3** gains:
- LangChain VectorStore adapter.
- MCP server.
- LlamaIndex adapter.
